What do I want my program to do?
- One moving pin flipper (Hit detection only on the front and right side)
- Ball that moves (hit detection of the entire ball)
- Pads to get extra points
- After a specific time the ball goes faster (30 seconds)

How I am ging to do it:
- I need a Runner
- I need a central file
- I need a graphics document(import all images)
- I need 2 documents for the sprites animation (Assigns the immages and re-paints them)
- I need a document for a sprite for the ball and flipper (The rules)
- I may need to make a sprite for the area(s) the ball has to go over to earn points
- I need a document to keep the score
